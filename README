Data-Reach

Data::Reach - Walk down a datastructure, without autovivification

The C<reach> function walks down a nested datastructure of hashrefs
and arrayrefs, choosing the next subnode at each step according to the
next key supplied in C<@path>. If there is no such sequence of
subnodes, C<undef> is returned. No autovivification nor any writing
into the datastructure is ever performed. Missing data merely returns
C<undef>, while wrong use of data (for example looking into an
arrayref with a non-numerical index) generates an exception.  Blessed
objects within the datastructure are generally treated just like raw,
unblessed datastructures; however that behaviour can be changed
through pragma options.
