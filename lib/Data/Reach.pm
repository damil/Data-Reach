      my $node = reach $object_tree, @path;
    }
    # after end of scope, back to the regular algorithm

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl supports nested datastructures : a hash may contain references to
other hashes or to arrays, which in turn may contain further references
to deeper structures -- see L<perldsc>. Walking down through such
structures usually involves nested loops, and possibly some tests on
C<ref $subtree> for finding out if the next level is an arrayref or a hashref.

The present module offers some utilities for easier handling of nested
datastructures :

=over

=item *

the C<reach> function finds a subtree or a leaf according to a given
C<@path> -- a list of hash keys or array indices. If there is no data
corresponding to that path, C<undef> is returned, without any autovivification
within the tree.

=item *

the C<map_paths> function applies a given code reference to all paths within the nested
datastructure.


=item *

the C<each_path> function returns an iterator over the nested datastructure; it can be
used in the same spirit as an C<each> statement over a simple hash, except that it will
walk through all paths within the nested datastructure

=back


The L</"SEE ALSO"> section
below discusses some alternative implementations.


=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 reach

  my $node = reach $data_tree, @path;

Tries to find a node under root C<$data_tree>, walking down
the tree and choosing subnodes according to values given in
C<@path> (which should be a list of scalar values). At each step :

=over

=item *

if the root is C<undef>, then C<undef> is returned (even if
there are remaining items in C<@path>)

=item *

if C<@path> is empty, then the root C<$data_tree> is returned

=item *

if the first item in C<@path> is C<undef>, then 
C<undef> is returned (even if there are remaining items in C<@path>).

=item *

if C<$data_tree> is a hashref or can behave as a hashref, then
C<< $data_tree->{$path[0]} >> becomes the new root,
and the first item from C<@path> is removed.
No distinction is made between a missing or an undefined
C<< $data_tree->{$path[0]} >> : in both cases the result
will be C<undef>.

=item *

if C<$data_tree> is an arrayref or can behave as an arrayref, then
C<< $data_tree->[$path[0]] >> becomes the new root,
and the first item from C<@path> is removed.
The value in C<< $path[0] >> must be an integer; otherwise
it is improper as an array index and an error is generated.
No distinction is made between a missing or an undefined
C<< $data_tree->[$path[0]] >> : in both cases the result
will be C<undef>.

=item *

if C<$data_tree> is any other kind of data (scalar, reference
to a scalar, reference to a reference, etc.), an error is generated.

=back

No autovivification nor any writing into the datastructure is ever
performed. Missing data merely returns C<undef>, while wrong use of
data (for example looking into an arrayref with a non-numerical index)
generates an exception.

By default, blessed objects are treated just like raw, unblessed
datastructures; however that behaviour can be changed through
pragma options, as described below.


=head2 map_paths

  my @result = map_paths { ... } $data_tree [, $max_depth];

Applies the given block to each path within C<$data_tree>, returning the list
of collected results. Within the block, C<@_> contains the
sequence of hash keys or array indices that were traversed, and C<$_> is aliased to
the leaf node. Hence, for a C<$data_tree> of shape :

  { foo => [ undef,
             'abc',
             {bar => {buz => 987}},
             1234,
            ],
    empty_slot  => undef,
    qux         => 'qux',  }

the block will be called six times, with the following values

  # value of @_              value of $_
  # ===========              ===========
   ('empty_slot,')             undef
   ('foo', 0)                  undef
   ('foo', 1)                  'abc'
   ('foo', 2, 'bar', 'buz')     987
   ('foo', 3)                  1234
   ('qux')                     'qux'

The optional C<$max_depth> argument limits the depth of tree traversal : subtrees
below that depth will be treated as leaves.

The C<$data_tree> argument is usually a reference to a hash or to an array;
but it can also be supplied directly as a hash or array -- this will be automatically
converted into a reference.

Unlike the L</reach> method, blessed objects are currently treated like raw datastructures;
this will be improved in a next release.

=head2 each_path

  my $next_path = each_path $data_tree [, $max_depth];
  while (my ($path, $val) = $next_path->()) {
    do_something_with($path, $val);
  }

Returns an iterator function that will walk through the datastructure.
Each call to the iterator will return a pair C<($path, $val)>, where
C<$path> is an arrayref that contains the sequence of hash keys or
array indices that were traversed, and C<$val> is the leaf node.

Unlike the L</reach> method, blessed objects are currently treated like raw datastructures;
this will be improved in a next release.

=head1 IMPORT INTERFACE

=head2 Exporting the 'reach', 'map_paths' and 'each_path' functions

The 'reach', 'map_paths' and 'each_path' functions are exported by default 
when C<use>ing this module :

  use Data::Reach;
  use Data::Reach qw/reach/; # equivalent to the line above

However the exported names can be changed through the C<as> option :

  use Data::Reach reach => as => 'walk_down', map_paths => as => 'find_subtrees';
  my $node = walk_down $data, @path;


=head2 Pragma options for reaching within objects

Arguments to the import method may also change the algorithm used to
C<reach> within objects. These options can be turned on or off as
lexical pragmata; this means that the effect of change of algorithm
is valid until the end of the current scope (see L<perlfunc/use>,
L<perlfunc/no> and L<perlpragma>).

=over

=item C<reach_method>

  use Data::Reach reach_method => 'foo';         # just one method
  use Data::Reach reach_method => [qw/foo bar/]; # an ordered list of methods

If the target object possesses a method corresponding to the
name(s) specified, that method will be called, with a single
argument corresponding to the current value in path.
The method is supposed to reach down one step into the
datastructure and return the next data subtree or leaf.

The presence of one of the required methods is the first
choice for reaching within an object. If this cannot be applied,
either because there was no required method, or because the
target object has none of them, then the second choice
is to use overloads, as described below.

=item C<use_overloads>

  use Data::Reach qw/use_overloads/; # turn the option on
  no  Data::Reach qw/use_overloads/; # turn the option off

This option is true by default; it means that if the object
has an overloaded hash or array dereferencing function,
that function will be called (see L<overload>). This feature
distinguishes C<Data::Reach> from other similar modules
listed in the L</"SEE ALSO"> section.

=item C<peek_blessed>

  use Data::Reach qw/peek_blessed/; # turn the option on
  no  Data::Reach qw/peek_blessed/; # turn the option off

This option is true by default; it means that the C<reach> functions
will go down into object implementations (i.e. reach internal attributes
within the object's hashref). Turn it off if you want objects to
stay opaque, with public methods as the only way to reach
internal information.

=back

Note that several options can be tuned in one single statement :

  no  Data::Reach qw/use_overloads peek_blessed/; # turn both options off


=head1 SEE ALSO

There are many similar modules on CPAN, each of them having some
variations in the set of features. Here are a few pointers, and the
reasons why I didn't use them :

=over 

=item L<Data::Diver>

Does quite a similar job, with a richer API (can also write into
the datastructure or use it as a lvalue). Return values may be 
complex to decode (distinctions between an empty list, an C<undef>,
or a singleton containing an C<undef>). It uses C<eval> internally,
without taking care of eval pitfalls (see L<Try::Tiny/BACKGROUND>
for explanations).


=item L<Data::DRef>

An old module (last update was in 1999), still relevant for
modern Perl, except that it does not handle overloads, which
were not available at that time. The API is a bit too rich to my
taste (many different ways to get or set data).

=item L<Data::DPath> or L<Data::Path>

Two competing modules for accessing nested data through expressions
similar to XPath. Very interesting, but a bit overkill for the needs
I wanted to cover here.

=item L<Data::Focus>

Creates a "focus" object that walks through the data using
various "lenses". An interesting approach, inspired by Haskell,
but also a bit overkill.

=item L<Data::PathSimple>

Very concise. The path is expressed as a '/'-separated string
instead of an array of values. Does not handle overloads.
